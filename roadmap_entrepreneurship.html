          <h2 style="color: darkorange;">Develop a business plan.</h2>
          
          <p>A business plan materializes your ideas onto paper and helps you to envision how your business will be operated.

          <h2 style="color: darkorange;">Be frugal.</h2>
          <p>Think twice before buying anything or signing a lease. To determine if the expenditure is a necessary and good investment, refer to your business plan and ask yourself how your purchase will contribute to the success of the business, as well as any additional costs you could be incurring, such as depreciation and maintenance costs.</p>

          <h2 style="color: darkorange;">Continuously educate yourself.</h2>
          <p>Be a voracious learner. You can attend live seminars or classes online. I also recommend reading books by a successful entrepreneur you admire. Even if they aren't in the same field as you, you could learn a lot from both their successes and failures.</p>

          <h2 style="color: darkorange;"> Build a winning team.</h2>
          <p>Behind every successful business is a reliable and competent team. This can include engaging an online personal assistant or working with a skilled accountant. Considering sales are the lifeblood of every business, I recommend making your first hire someone who can facilitate revenue by either increasing sales or making the sales process more efficient.</p>

          <h2 style="color: darkorange;">Find a mentor.</h2>
          <p>Having a mentor you can trust is a valuable asset. Whether youâ€™re in a mastermind group or have stayed in touch with your former teachers or other business associates, guidance is always valuable. Work with someone who has climbed that very mountain you are trying to navigate to shorten your learning curve.</p>
